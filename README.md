# White-Roofs
Townsville City Council's White Roofs project sees the promotion of painted white roofs in North Queensland as practical energy reduction measure. This project demonstrates a proof-of-concept test setup, wherein the temperature of a number of identical miniature houses with different coloured roofs are monitored.
